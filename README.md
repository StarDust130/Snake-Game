# Snake Game 🐍
This is a simple Snake game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played on a grid board where the player controls a snake that moves around and eats food items to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

## Getting Started 🚀
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The game will start automatically and you can use the arrow keys to control the snake.

## Game Rules 🎮
#### The snake moves continuously in the direction it is facing.
#### The player can change the direction of the snake using the arrow keys.
#### The snake grows longer each time it eats a food item.
#### The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
#### The player can restart the game by refreshing the page.

## Project Structure 📁

#### index.html: The main HTML file that contains the game board and controls.
#### styles.css: The CSS file that styles the game board and controls.
